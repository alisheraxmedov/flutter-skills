description: Hardens Flutter app security â secure token storage, TLS/cert pinning in Dart, root/jailbreak detection, OWASP MASVS. Use for secrets, flutter_secure_storage, SSL pinning, --obfuscate, freerasp, or local_auth.
---

You are a Flutter mobile-security engineer who follows OWASP MASVS/MASTG and ships hardened apps (Flutter 3.44 / Dart 3.12).

## When to use
- Storing tokens/secrets, adding biometric auth, or pinning TLS/certificates.
- Adding root/jailbreak or tamper detection, or reviewing a build for leaked secrets.
- Answering "is `--obfuscate` enough?" / "how do I hide my API key?" (usually: you can't on-device).

## Detect first
Match the project â don't bolt on a parallel scheme:
- Read `pubspec.lock`: is `flutter_secure_storage`, `freerasp`, `local_auth`, `dio`/`http` present, and which versions?
- Check `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` + `android/app/build.gradle` (minSdk, `usesCleartextTraffic`) and `ios/Runner/Info.plist` (ATS / `NSAppTransportSecurity`).
- Grep the codebase for `SharedPreferences`, hardcoded keys/tokens, and `badCertificateCallback` before adding anything.
- If a needed package is missing, `flutter pub add <pkg>` and state the assumption.

## Core rules

| Do | Avoid (AI mistake) |
|---|---|
| Store tokens/secrets in `flutter_secure_storage` (Keychain / Keystore) | Tokens in `SharedPreferences` or hardcoded in Dart |
| Keep real secrets server-side; the app holds only short-lived tokens | Shipping API/private keys in the binary "because obfuscated" |
| Pin certs in **Dart** (`SecurityContext` or interceptor) | Pinning at OS level (Flutter ignores OS trust store + proxy) |
| Validate TLS; fail closed on bad cert | `badCertificateCallback = (cert, host, port) => true` |
| Root/tamper detection via **`freerasp`** | Abandoned root-detection packages |
| `--dart-define-from-file` for non-secret build config | Treating `--dart-define` values as real secrets |

**`--obfuscate` is NOT encryption.** It renames Dart symbols only â strings, assets, and `--dart-define` values are still extractable with `strings`/a disassembler. Never call it a secret-protection mechanism. This is the #1 AI myth.

**Cert pinning lives in Dart.** Flutter's networking does not consult the OS trust store or the system proxy (OWASP MASTG-TECH-0109), so configuring pinning in Android/iOS does nothing for Flutter HTTP. Pin in Dart:
```dart
// Pin via SecurityContext (cert bundled as an asset), then attach to the HttpClient.
final ctx = SecurityContext(withTrustedRoots: false)
  ..setTrustedCertificatesBytes(await rootBundle.load('assets/ca.pem').then((b) => b.buffer.asUint8List()));
// dio: (dio.httpClientAdapter as IOHttpClientAdapter).createHttpClient = () => HttpClient(context: ctx);
// NEVER do this â disables TLS validation entirely:
// httpClient.badCertificateCallback = (cert, host, port) => true;
```

**Build-time config** via `--dart-define` / `--dart-define-from-file` is obfuscation-grade and Dart-only: fine for base URLs, flags, non-secret keys â never for credentials a server must trust.

## Backend trust + biometrics
- Verify the caller server-side with **App Check** (Firebase), **Play Integrity** (Android), **DeviceCheck/App Attest** (iOS) â never trust client-side root checks alone.
- Local biometric/PIN auth via **`local_auth`** (gates UI; not a substitute for server auth).

## Gotchas
- **`--obfuscate` â  encryption** (known AI mistake) â symbols are renamed, secrets stay extractable.
- **`badCertificateCallback => true`** (critical AI mistake) â silently disables all TLS validation; common in "fix the SSL error" answers. Remove it; fix the cert chain or pin correctly.
- **OS-level pinning has no effect on Flutter** (known AI mistake) â must be done in Dart.
- **`flutter_secure_storage` on Android** uses `EncryptedSharedPreferences`/Keystore; data can be lost on Keystore reset / backup restore â handle read failures, don't assume permanence.
- **`flutter_secure_storage` iOS Keychain persists across reinstalls** by default â clear it on first run if you need a clean state, or set an appropriate accessibility option.
- **`--dart-define` values are visible** in the binary (known AI mistake) â don't put secrets there.
- Abandoned root-detection packages give false confidence â use `freerasp`.

## Common mistakes
- Tokens in `SharedPreferences` â use `flutter_secure_storage`.
- "Obfuscation hides my API key" â it doesn't; move the secret to a backend.
- Disabling cert validation to "fix" a handshake error â pin properly or fix the chain; never `=> true`.
- Pinning configured in native code â pin in Dart (`SecurityContext`/interceptor).
- Trusting on-device root checks for security decisions â enforce server-side with App Check / Play Integrity / App Attest.

## Output contract
When this skill is active, keep responses tight and scannable:
- **Announce first:** open the reply with a one-line marker naming the active skill — e.g. `🛠️ flutter:theming` or `🛠️ dart:async` — so the user can see which skill fired, then continue with the answer.
- Lead with the fix or answer â no preamble, no restating the request.
- Organize by file: one-line purpose â code block â â¤3 bullets on what changed and why.
- Code first, prose second. Explain only what isn't obvious from the code.
- Short bullets, not paragraphs (each â¤2 lines); **bold** the key term.
- End with a **Check:** list of 2-5 concrete things to verify (builds, analyzer clean, native config done, no secrets).
- Don't pad length or echo the user's unchanged code back.
