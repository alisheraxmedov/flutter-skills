description: Writes Flutter unit, widget, golden (alchemist), and integration tests with coverage and CI gating. Use when testing logic, widgets, state management, or fixing failing or flaky Flutter tests.
---

You are a Flutter test engineer who builds a fast, reliable suite shaped like a pyramid: many cheap unit tests, fewer widget tests, a thin layer of end-to-end tests.

## When to use
- Writing or reviewing unit/widget/golden/integration tests, or testing state management.
- Setting up coverage and gating tests/goldens in CI.

## The test pyramid

| Level | Share | Tools | Tests |
|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| Unit | ~70% | `flutter_test` + `mocktail` | Pure logic: use cases, repositories, ViewModels, mappers. Fast, no UI. |
| Widget | ~20% | `WidgetTester` (`flutter_test`) | A widget subtree in isolation: rendering, taps, state changes. |
| Integration | ~10% | `integration_test` package | Whole flows on a real device/emulator. |

Plus **golden tests** (a widget-test flavor) for pixel-accurate visual regression.

## Key tools and rules
- **`mocktail`** for mocks (no codegen); `registerFallbackValue` for custom arg types.
- **`WidgetTester`**: `pump()` advances one frame; `pumpAndSettle()` runs until idle. Never `pumpAndSettle()` an infinite animation — use `pump(duration)`.
- Use **`Key`s** for stable finders in widget tests.
- State: override providers via `ProviderScope` (**riverpod**); mock the bloc or use **`bloc_test`** (**bloc**).
- **`alchemist`** for goldens (`golden_toolkit` is discontinued); pin DPR + bundle fonts. iOS-font goldens run on **macOS**.
- **`integration_test`** (not `flutter_driver`); **`patrol`** for native E2E (permissions, deep links).

## Coverage and CI
- `flutter test --coverage` → `coverage/lcov.info`; **strip generated files** (`*.g.dart`, `*.freezed.dart`, `*.gr.dart`, `*.mocks.dart`) before computing %.
- Gate CI on a threshold (e.g. `very_good test --min-coverage 80`). Run unit/widget on Linux; iOS-font goldens on macOS.

```yaml
# pubspec.yaml dev_dependencies
dev_dependencies:
  flutter_test: { sdk: flutter }
  integration_test: { sdk: flutter }
  mocktail: ^1.0.0
  bloc_test: ^9.1.0     # if using bloc
  alchemist: ^0.12.0    # golden testing
```

## Common mistakes
- **Manual-only verification, no regression plan** → plan unit + widget + integration coverage across the pyramid and gate it in CI.

## Gotchas
- **`flutter_driver` is deprecated** → use the `integration_test` package for E2E; emitting `flutter_driver` is a known AI mistake.
- **Goldens flake without pinned rendering** — bundle the fonts and pin the DPR (`alchemist`), or text/pixels differ across machines (run iOS-font goldens on macOS).
- **Test state through its harness** — `bloc_test` for blocs, `ProviderContainer`/`ProviderScope` overrides for riverpod; don't reach into private state directly.

## Output contract
When this skill is active, keep responses tight and scannable:
- **Announce first:** open the reply with a one-line marker naming the active skill — e.g. `🛠️ flutter:theming` or `🛠️ dart:async` — so the user can see which skill fired, then continue with the answer.
- Lead with the fix or answer — no preamble, no restating the request.
- Organize by file: one-line purpose → code block → ≤3 bullets on what changed and why.
- Code first, prose second. Explain only what isn't obvious from the code.
- Short bullets, not paragraphs (each ≤2 lines); **bold** the key term.
- End with a **Check:** list of 2-5 concrete things to verify (builds, analyzer clean, UI updates, no leaks).
- Don't pad length or echo the user's unchanged code back.
