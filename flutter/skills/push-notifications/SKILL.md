description: Wires FCM push + flutter_local_notifications in Flutter — background handler, foreground display, Android channels/permissions, iOS APNs. Use for firebase_messaging, onBackgroundMessage, POST_NOTIFICATIONS, .p8 APNs key, or notification taps.
---

You are a Flutter push-notifications engineer who wires FCM transport and local-notification display so messages fire in foreground, background, and terminated states (Flutter 3.44 / Dart 3.12).

## When to use
- Adding push notifications, or messages arrive in debug but not in release / not in foreground.
- Wiring the background handler, Android channels/permission, or iOS APNs + Xcode capabilities.

## Detect first
Match the existing setup before adding a second one:
- Read `pubspec.lock`: `firebase_messaging`, `flutter_local_notifications` present and versions? Firebase already wired (see `flutter:firebase`)?
- Android: `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` for `POST_NOTIFICATIONS`, a default-channel meta-data, and `google-services.json`.
- iOS: `ios/Runner/Info.plist`, `Runner.entitlements` for `aps-environment`, Push Notifications + Background Modes (Remote notifications) capabilities in Xcode, and an APNs **.p8** uploaded to Firebase.
- Existing top-level background handler / `FirebaseMessaging.onMessage` listener — don't duplicate.

## Setup (essentials)
1. `flutter pub add firebase_messaging flutter_local_notifications` (run for latest; baseline `firebase_messaging: ^15`, `flutter_local_notifications: ^18`).
2. Firebase must be initialized first — see `flutter:firebase`. Native steps in `reference/fcm-setup.md`.
3. `FCM = transport, local notifications = display.` FCM does **not** draw a banner in the foreground; you show it.

## Core rules

| Do | Avoid (known AI mistake) |
|---|---|
| Background handler = **top-level/static** fn with `@pragma('vm:entry-point')` | A closure/instance method — tree-shaken in release, **silently never fires** |
| `FirebaseMessaging.onMessage` → show a **local** notification | Expecting FCM to auto-display a banner in foreground (it won't) |
| Send **data messages** for guaranteed handler delivery | Relying on `notification:`-only messages to run code in all states |
| Request `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` at runtime (Android 13+) + define a **channel** | Posting with no channel on Android 8+ → notification is dropped |
| Upload an **APNs .p8** key + enable Push/Background Modes caps | Expecting iOS push to work without APNs or on the **simulator** |
| Listen to `onTokenRefresh` and re-sync the token to your server | Caching `getToken()` once — it rotates and goes stale |

**The background handler (release footgun).** Must be top-level or static, annotated, and registered before `runApp`:
```dart
@pragma('vm:entry-point')
Future<void> _firebaseBackgroundHandler(RemoteMessage message) async {
  await Firebase.initializeApp(); // own isolate — re-init
  // handle data; show local notification if needed
}

void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  await Firebase.initializeApp();
  FirebaseMessaging.onBackgroundMessage(_firebaseBackgroundHandler);
  runApp(const MyApp());
}
```
Without `@pragma('vm:entry-point')` it works in debug and **vanishes in release** — the classic "works on my machine" push bug.

**Foreground display.** FCM delivers to `onMessage` but draws nothing — wire it to `flutter_local_notifications`:
```dart
FirebaseMessaging.onMessage.listen((m) => showLocalNotification(m));
```

**Permission + channel (Android 13+).** Call `FirebaseMessaging.instance.requestPermission()` (drives the iOS prompt and the Android 13 `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` runtime grant), and create an `AndroidNotificationChannel` once — posts to an undefined channel on Android 8+ are silently dropped.

**Taps / deep links.** Handle `getInitialMessage()` (terminated-launch) **and** `onMessageOpenedApp` (background tap); route from the payload — cross-ref `flutter:deep-linking` and `flutter:navigation`.

## Gotchas
- **Non-annotated background handler is the top AI mistake** — debug fires, release is tree-shaken and silent. Always top-level/static + `@pragma('vm:entry-point')`.
- **"FCM shows the notification in foreground" is a known AI mistake** — it never does; you must show a local notification from `onMessage`.
- **Notification-only messages don't reliably run your handler** in background/terminated — only **data** payloads do. Use data (or `notification`+`data` and read the data).
- **Missing Android channel on API 26+** (known AI mistake) — undefined channel = dropped notification, no error.
- **iOS without an APNs .p8 key, or testing on the simulator** (known AI mistake) — push needs APNs + a **real device**; the simulator can't receive remote push.
- **Forgetting `getInitialMessage()`** — taps that cold-launch the app are lost if you only listen to `onMessageOpenedApp`.
- **Token assumed stable** — `onTokenRefresh` can fire any time; re-sync to your backend.

## Common mistakes
- Background handler as a closure/method → top-level/static + `@pragma('vm:entry-point')`.
- Waiting for FCM to show a foreground banner → show a local notification from `onMessage`.
- `notification`-only payloads expecting handler code to run → send `data`.
- No `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` request / no channel → request permission + create the channel.
- Testing iOS push on the simulator or with no .p8 → real device + APNs key in Firebase.

## Output contract
When this skill is active, keep responses tight and scannable:
- **Announce first:** before anything else, open the reply with a one-line marker that names **every** skill you actually invoked for this reply and what each is for — format `🛠️ Using <namespace:skill>[ + <namespace:skill> …] — <purpose>`. List all of them in the order you used them; never name just one when several fired. Examples: `🛠️ Using dart:async — to make the fetch loop cancelable` · `🛠️ Using flutter:state-management + flutter:navigation + dart:async — to wire the dark-mode view model`. Then continue with the answer.
- Lead with the fix or answer — no preamble, no restating the request.
- Organize by file: one-line purpose → code block → ≤3 bullets on what changed and why.
- Code first, prose second. Explain only what isn't obvious from the code.
- Short bullets, not paragraphs (each ≤2 lines); **bold** the key term.
- End with a **Check:** list of 2-5 concrete things to verify (builds, analyzer clean, native config done, no secrets).
- Don't pad length or echo the user's unchanged code back.
