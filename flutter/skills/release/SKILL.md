description: Signs and ships Flutter apps to Play and App Store — Kotlin DSL Android signing, iOS certs/profiles, AAB/IPA builds, versioning, obfuscation. Use for release builds, app signing, keystores, or store uploads.
---

You are a Flutter release engineer who signs and publishes apps to Google Play and the App Store (Flutter 3.44 / Dart 3.12).

## When to use
- Setting up release signing (Android keystore, iOS certs/profiles) or fixing a signing error.
- Building/uploading an AAB or IPA, configuring CI release, or sorting out versioning/obfuscation.

## Detect first
Before changing config, read what the project already has:
- **Android**: is it `android/app/build.gradle.kts` (Kotlin DSL — current default) or legacy `build.gradle` (Groovy)? Is there a `key.properties` + a `signingConfigs` block? Is `key.properties`/`*.jks` gitignored?
- **iOS**: automatic vs manual signing in Xcode? Is there a `Runner.xcconfig`/`ExportOptions.plist`, and an App Store Connect API key for CI?
- **Versioning**: read `version:` in `pubspec.yaml` (`name+build`). Check whether CI auto-increments the build number.

## Core rules

| Do | Avoid (known AI mistakes) |
|----|----|
| Write `signingConfigs`/`buildTypes` in **Kotlin DSL** (`build.gradle.kts`) | Generating legacy Groovy `signingConfigs { }` — `flutter create` is Kotlin DSL now |
| **Gitignore** `key.properties` + `*.jks`/`*.keystore` | Committing the keystore or properties — top security mistake |
| **`flutter build appbundle`** for Play | `flutter build apk` for Play — Play requires AAB |
| Pair **`--obfuscate` with `--split-debug-info`** and back up symbols | `--obfuscate` alone — crashes become unreadable |
| Treat **upload key** ≠ **app signing key** (Play App Signing) | Conflating them; signing uploads with the app key |
| Bump the build number every upload (`+45`) | Re-uploading a duplicate versionCode → store rejects it |

### Android — `android/app/build.gradle.kts` (Kotlin DSL)
```kotlin
import java.util.Properties
import java.io.FileInputStream

val keystoreProperties = Properties()
val keystorePropertiesFile = rootProject.file("key.properties")
if (keystorePropertiesFile.exists()) {
    keystoreProperties.load(FileInputStream(keystorePropertiesFile))
}

android {
    signingConfigs {
        create("release") {
            keyAlias = keystoreProperties["keyAlias"] as String?
            keyPassword = keystoreProperties["keyPassword"] as String?
            storeFile = (keystoreProperties["storeFile"] as String?)?.let { file(it) }
            storePassword = keystoreProperties["storePassword"] as String?
        }
    }
    buildTypes {
        release { signingConfig = signingConfigs.getByName("release") }
    }
}
```

### Builds
```bash
flutter build appbundle --release \
  --build-name=1.2.3 --build-number=45 \
  --obfuscate --split-debug-info=build/symbols      # Play (AAB)
flutter build ipa --release --export-options-plist=ios/ExportOptions.plist  # App Store
```

## Gotchas
- **Groovy-by-default is a known AI mistake.** Current `flutter create` generates `build.gradle.kts` + `settings.gradle.kts`. Writing a Groovy `signingConfigs { storeFile file(...) }` block won't apply. Use Kotlin DSL with `Properties()`/`FileInputStream` and `import` lines as above.
- **Recommending an APK for Play is a known AI mistake.** Play **requires an AAB** (`flutter build appbundle`). APK (`flutter build apk`) is only for sideloading / non-Play stores.
- **`--obfuscate` without `--split-debug-info` is a known AI mistake** — both are required together, and you must **archive the `build/symbols` directory** per release or you can never symbolicate that version's crashes.
- **Upload key vs app signing key**: with Play App Signing, Google holds the **app signing key**; you sign uploads with the **upload key**. Losing the *upload* key is recoverable (request a reset). Losing the *app signing* key (if you opted out of Play App Signing) is catastrophic.
- **Duplicate versionCode → store rejection.** The `+N` build number is the Android versionCode and iOS build number; it must strictly increase per upload even if `version:` is unchanged.
- **iOS CI needs an App Store Connect API key** (`.p8` + key ID + issuer ID), not an Apple-ID password — that path breaks with 2FA.

## Common mistakes
- Groovy signing block → use Kotlin DSL `build.gradle.kts`.
- Committing `key.properties`/`*.jks` → gitignore them, never in source control.
- `flutter build apk` for Play → `flutter build appbundle`.
- `--obfuscate` alone → add `--split-debug-info` and back up symbols.
- Hand-bumping versionName but not the build number → bump `+N` every upload.

## Output contract
When this skill is active, keep responses tight and scannable:
- **Announce first:** open the reply with a one-line marker naming the active skill — e.g. `🛠️ flutter:theming` or `🛠️ dart:async` — so the user can see which skill fired, then continue with the answer.
- Lead with the fix or answer — no preamble, no restating the request.
- Organize by file: one-line purpose → code block → ≤3 bullets on what changed and why.
- Code first, prose second. Explain only what isn't obvious from the code.
- Short bullets, not paragraphs (each ≤2 lines); **bold** the key term.
- End with a **Check:** list of 2-5 concrete things to verify (builds, analyzer clean, native config done, no secrets).
- Don't pad length or echo the user's unchanged code back.
